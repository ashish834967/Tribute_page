            <p class="about" > Swami Vivekananda ji’s original name was Narendranath. He was born on 12th January, 1863 at Kolkata (Swamiji’s Jayanti i.e. birth anniversary is celebrated as the ‘International Youth Day’). Right from childhood, two aspects of his behavior could clearly be noticed. One was his devout and compassionate nature and the other was his readiness to perform any act of courage. Since his whole family was spiritually inclined, he received an appropriate religious upbringing.<br><br>Swami Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".
